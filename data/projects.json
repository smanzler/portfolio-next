    "longDescription": "Dash is a mobile running app built as an MVP to validate an idea developed for an entrepreneurship course. The app allows users to create custom running routes on a map and then run those routes while tracking performance data. The project was also an opportunity to deepen native iOS experience by building all map-related UI and GPS logic in Swift and bridging it into a React Native app using Expo native modules.",
